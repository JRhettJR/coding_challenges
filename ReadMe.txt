Write Python code that parses out attached data and puts it into tables in a data warehouse (any distribution of MySQL or SQL Server will do). 

We are looking to see how you choose to design dimensions and fact tables, how you break down the different steps into multiple manageable chunks, general coding style, organization, code comments, etc. 

We want to see how you communicate technical details to other Engineers via your code.

Please use Airflow for workflow management to complete this exercise.

The completed work can be returned to us in a zipped/compressed package that we can extract, build and run; or through a public repository such as GitHub.

We would like you to spend no more than a couple hours of your time on this.
